                <p>My dear Akansha, this little piece of work is supposed to be your birthday present. This was being planned since April and finally it has gained it's form. First I thought to make it hard but then situation changed. To be real honest, my true motive behind staying here and joining MEAN was to be able to make as lovely site as possible for the special lady of my life. Each day I would return from my classes and implement whatever i learned. Although my lack of creativity would be clearly visible throughout my work but I hope I could reach near you satisfaction. Love you baby... :* </p>

You would have been a lot happier if things would not have turned this way and i am to be blamed for all that. I just want to say that you are a good and real person. Not something like me. You will get true happiness in your life soon. I have always hurt you, even when we were together and even after all this. I could never give you happiness. I was a big disappointment for you. I always tried but could never succeed. If it were a game, you would have pulled up a clean sheet. Well a person like you dont deserve a loser like me. I hope for a very bright future for you...</p>
